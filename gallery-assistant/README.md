# The Rasa Chatbot

This is a chatbot for a Virtual Art Gallery.

### Note

The trained model should go in a `models` subdirectory here. However, the model is too large to upload to Github (the file is 30MB large). Consequently, the trained model file was not uploaded. To re-create this file, one simply calls `rasa train`
